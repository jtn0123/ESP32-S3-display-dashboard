# ESP LCD 6-Block Fix Summary

## Version: v5.40-6blkfix

Successfully implemented a targeted fix for the "blocky display with 6 readable blocks" issue.

## What Was Fixed

### Root Cause Analysis
The 6-block pattern indicated a systematic DMA transfer or timing issue where only every 6th pixel/block was being displayed correctly.

### Applied Fixes

1. **Clock Speed Reduction**
   - Reduced from 17 MHz to 5 MHz
   - Slower clock gives display controller more time to process data

2. **Transfer Size Alignment**
   - Aligned transfers to 12-byte boundaries (6 pixels in RGB565)
   - Also ensured 64-byte cache line alignment for PSRAM

3. **Queue Depth Reduction**
   - Set to 1 for synchronous transfers
   - Ensures each transfer completes before next begins

4. **SRAM Alignment**
   - Changed from 4-byte to 12-byte alignment
   - Matches the 6-pixel pattern observed

## Code Changes

### `esp_lcd_6block_fix.rs`
- `apply_6block_fix()` - Applies all fixes to bus and IO config
- `analyze_6block_pattern()` - Debug patterns to verify fix
- `test_clock_speeds()` - Tests if issue is clock-related

### Integration
The fix is automatically applied during ESP LCD initialization:
```rust
// In lcd_cam_esp_hal.rs
info!("Detected 6-block pattern issue - applying targeted fix...");
super::esp_lcd_6block_fix::apply_6block_fix(&mut bus_config, &mut io_config)?;
```

## Test Patterns

When the device boots with this fix, it will show:
1. Single pixels at 6-pixel intervals
2. 6-pixel wide colored blocks
3. Continuous pattern with 6-pixel markers

If the fix works:
- You should see smooth patterns instead of blocky output
- The version "v5.40-6blkfix" should be clearly readable
- All test patterns should display correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Power cycle the device** to apply the fix
2. **Observe the display** during boot:
   - Look for the test patterns
   - Check if text is readable
   - Verify smooth color gradients

3. **If still blocky**:
   - Try even slower clock (2 MHz)
   - Adjust transfer size to different multiples
   - Check for hardware issues

## Technical Details

The 6-block pattern strongly suggested:
- DMA descriptors were aligned to 6-pixel boundaries
- Or timing windows were creating a 1-in-6 success rate
- Or the I80 interface was only latching data every 6th cycle

The fix addresses all these possibilities by:
- Slowing down the interface
- Aligning transfers properly
- Ensuring synchronous operation
