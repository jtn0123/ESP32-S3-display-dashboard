# ESP32-S3 Display Dashboard Performance Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines performance improvement opportunities for the ESP32-S3 Display Dashboard, excluding the known LCD_CAM hardware acceleration issue. Each improvement includes research findings, implementation approach, and verification methods.

## Current Performance Baseline
- **Display**: 10 FPS (GPIO bit-banging limitation)
- **CPU**: 240MHz max, DFS enabled (80-240MHz)
- **Memory**: ~300KB free heap, 2MB PSRAM available but underutilized
- **Power**: No sleep modes, constant full power

## Improvement Areas

### 1. Display Rendering Optimizations
**Goal**: Maximize efficiency within the 10 FPS hardware constraint

#### 1.1 Dirty Rectangle Tracking
- **Current**: Basic implementation exists but not fully utilized
- **Research Findings**: 
  - Dirty rectangles only redraw changed screen portions, saving CPU cycles
  - Common approach: Store rectangles in std::vector, merge overlapping regions
  - For embedded: Use fixed-size array to avoid dynamic allocation
  - Coalesce rectangles when count gets high to reduce draw calls
  - Libraries like LovyanGFX and TFT_eSPI implement this effectively
- **Implementation Approach**:
  1. Track up to 16 dirty rectangles in fixed array
  2. Merge overlapping/adjacent rectangles
  3. If >10 rectangles, merge all into bounding box
  4. Only send changed regions to display
- **Verification**: Measure time spent in flush() before/after

#### 1.2 Frame Buffer with Differential Updates
- **Current**: Frame buffer exists but disabled
- **Research Findings**:
  - PSRAM ideal for frame buffers but needs cache management
  - ESP32-S3: CPU uses cache, DMA bypasses it - causes coherency issues
  - Solution: Use Cache_WriteBack_Addr() after writing to PSRAM
  - LovyanGFX uses "Sprite" class for off-screen buffers
  - Double buffering prevents tearing, enables differential updates
- **Implementation Approach**:
  1. Allocate 2 frame buffers in PSRAM (300x168x2 bytes each = ~100KB)
  2. Compare buffers pixel-by-pixel or in blocks
  3. Send only changed blocks to display
  4. Always flush cache after PSRAM writes
- **Verification**: Logic analyzer to confirm reduced data transfers

#### 1.3 Drawing Operation Batching
- **Current**: Each draw operation immediately writes to display
- **Research Needed**: Optimal batch sizes for ST7789
- **Implementation**: Queue operations, flush in batches
- **Verification**: Profile draw call overhead reduction

### 2. Memory Optimization
**Goal**: Reduce allocations and utilize PSRAM effectively

#### 2.1 PSRAM Frame Buffer
- **Current**: 2MB PSRAM available but unused for display
- **Research Findings**:
  - Use heap_caps_malloc(size, MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM) for PSRAM allocation
  - In Rust: Available via esp_idf_sys bindings
  - PSRAM access slower than internal RAM but good for large buffers
  - Cache coherency critical: esp_idf_sys::Cache_WriteBack_Addr()
  - Alignment matters: 16-byte alignment improves DMA performance
- **Implementation Approach**:
  1. Use heap_caps_malloc with MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM flag
  2. Ensure 16-byte alignment for DMA efficiency
  3. Implement cache flush wrapper for safety
  4. Create PSRAM allocator module for reuse
- **Verification**: Monitor PSRAM usage stats

#### 2.2 Pre-allocated Buffers
- **Current**: Repeated allocations in comprehensive_memory_init()
- **Research Needed**: Static vs dynamic allocation trade-offs
- **Implementation**: Create buffer pool for common operations
- **Verification**: Heap fragmentation analysis

### 3. Task Scheduling & CPU Usage
**Goal**: Better utilize dual-core architecture

#### 3.1 Sensor Sampling on Core 1
- **Current**: All tasks on Core 0
- **Research Findings**:
  - ESP32-S3 has two cores: CPU0 (PRO_CPU) and CPU1 (APP_CPU)
  - Use xTaskCreatePinnedToCore() to pin tasks to specific core
  - Core 0 typically handles WiFi/BT, Core 1 for user apps
  - In Rust: Access via unsafe FFI with esp_idf_sys
  - Task affinity improves determinism and load distribution
- **Implementation Approach**:
  1. Create sensor task with xTaskCreatePinnedToCore(..., 1)
  2. Use unsafe extern "C" functions for task entry
  3. Move sensor sampling logic to dedicated task
  4. Use FreeRTOS queues for inter-core communication
- **Verification**: Core usage statistics

#### 3.2 Main Loop Rate Optimization
- **Current**: 60 FPS cap but display only does 10 FPS
- **Research Needed**: Optimal update rates for UI responsiveness
- **Implementation**: Adaptive frame rate based on activity
- **Verification**: Power consumption measurements

### 4. Network Performance
**Goal**: Reduce WiFi overhead and improve reliability

#### 4.1 Background Signal Monitoring
- **Current**: Signal strength only checked on connect
- **Research Needed**: ESP-IDF WiFi event callbacks
- **Implementation**: Periodic background RSSI updates
- **Verification**: Network stability metrics

### 5. Power Management
**Goal**: Reduce power consumption during idle

#### 5.1 Dynamic Frequency Scaling Enhancement
- **Current**: Basic DFS 80-240MHz
- **Research Findings**:
  - esp_pm_configure() enables DFS and auto light-sleep
  - Set light_sleep_enable=true in esp_pm_config_t
  - Power management adds 0.2-40Î¼s interrupt latency
  - Use power locks to prevent sleep during critical ops
  - CPU auto-scales based on load when configured
- **Implementation Approach**:
  1. Enable light_sleep_enable in PM config
  2. Use PM locks during display updates
  3. Lower min_freq_mhz to 40MHz for deeper power savings
  4. Monitor wake latency impact on responsiveness
- **Verification**: Current consumption measurements

#### 5.2 Light Sleep During Idle
- **Current**: No sleep modes used
- **Research Findings**:
  - Light sleep: ~0.8mA vs active ~40-80mA
  - Wake latency: <1ms
  - Peripherals clock-gated, context preserved
  - Display will be blank during sleep (peripherals stopped)
  - Auto light-sleep uses FreeRTOS tickless idle
  - CONFIG_FREERTOS_IDLE_TIME_BEFORE_SLEEP sets threshold
- **Implementation Approach**:
  1. Enable CONFIG_FREERTOS_USE_TICKLESS_IDLE
  2. Set idle threshold to 50ms (5 display frames)
  3. Use PM locks to keep awake during user interaction
  4. Wake on button GPIO interrupts
- **Verification**: Power profiler measurements

### 6. Code-Level Optimizations
**Goal**: Reduce CPU cycles in hot paths

#### 6.1 Direct Register Access for GPIO
- **Current**: Using HAL layer for pin operations
- **Research Needed**: Safe direct GPIO register manipulation
- **Implementation**: Replace HAL calls in write_byte()
- **Verification**: Oscilloscope timing measurements

#### 6.2 Aggressive Inlining
- **Current**: Some functions marked inline
- **Research Needed**: Profile-guided optimization
- **Implementation**: Inline all hot-path functions
- **Verification**: Binary size vs performance trade-off

## Next Steps - Start with Dirty Rectangle Tracking

### Step 1: Create Performance Benchmark
Before implementing any optimization, we need baseline measurements:
1. Add performance counters to DisplayManager
2. Track metrics per frame:
   - Total pixels written
   - Number of draw calls
   - Time spent in each drawing function
   - Time spent in flush()
3. Log averages every second

### Step 2: Implement Dirty Rectangle Tracking
1. Enhance existing DirtyRect structure
2. Add fixed-size array for tracking multiple rectangles
3. Implement merge algorithm
4. Modify flush() to only update dirty regions
5. Test with various UI scenarios

### Step 3: Measure and Validate
1. Compare metrics before/after implementation
2. Verify display correctness
3. Check for visual artifacts
4. Document performance improvement

Only proceed to PSRAM frame buffer after dirty rectangles are stable and showing measurable improvement.
