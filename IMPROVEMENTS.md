## Performance Improvements

### Overview
This section outlines performance improvements achieved and additional opportunities. The major milestone of migrating to ESP_LCD DMA driver has been completed, achieving 5-6x performance improvement.

## Performance History

### Previous Baseline (GPIO Mode)
- **Display**: 10 FPS (GPIO bit-banging limitation)
- **CPU**: High usage due to blocking I/O
- **Memory**: ~300KB free heap, 2MB PSRAM available but underutilized

### Current Performance (ESP_LCD DMA Mode - v5.53+)
- **Display**: 55-65 FPS (DMA acceleration)
- **CPU**: Significantly reduced usage - DMA offloads display updates
- **Memory**: Same as before
- **Power**: No sleep modes, constant full power

## Major Achievement: ESP_LCD DMA Driver Migration ✅

Successfully migrated from GPIO bit-banging to ESP-IDF's esp_lcd DMA driver:
- **Performance**: 10 FPS → 55-65 FPS (5-6x improvement)
- **CPU Usage**: Dramatically reduced - DMA handles transfers
- **Implementation**: Resolved struct alignment issues between ESP-IDF versions
- **Key Fix**: Switched to PERF optimization to avoid multiple DROM segments

## Improvement Areas

### 1. Display Rendering Optimizations
**Goal**: Further optimize rendering efficiency now that DMA provides 55-65 FPS capability

#### 1.1 Dirty Rectangle Tracking
- **Current**: Basic implementation exists but not fully utilized
- **Research Findings**: 
  - Dirty rectangles only redraw changed screen portions, saving CPU cycles
  - Common approach: Store rectangles in std::vector, merge overlapping regions
  - For embedded: Use fixed-size array to avoid dynamic allocation
  - Coalesce rectangles when count gets high to reduce draw calls
  - Libraries like LovyanGFX and TFT_eSPI implement this effectively
- **Implementation Approach**:
  1. Track up to 16 dirty rectangles in fixed array
  2. Merge overlapping/adjacent rectangles
  3. If >10 rectangles, merge all into bounding box
  4. Only send changed regions to display
- **Verification**: Measure time spent in flush() before/after

#### 1.2 Frame Buffer with Differential Updates
- **Current**: Frame buffer exists but disabled
- **Research Findings**:
  - PSRAM ideal for frame buffers but needs cache management
  - ESP32-S3: CPU uses cache, DMA bypasses it - causes coherency issues
  - Solution: Use Cache_WriteBack_Addr() after writing to PSRAM
  - LovyanGFX uses "Sprite" class for off-screen buffers
  - Double buffering prevents tearing, enables differential updates
- **Implementation Approach**:
  1. Allocate 2 frame buffers in PSRAM (300x168x2 bytes each = ~100KB)
  2. Compare buffers pixel-by-pixel or in blocks
  3. Send only changed blocks to display
  4. Always flush cache after PSRAM writes
- **Verification**: Logic analyzer to confirm reduced data transfers

#### 1.3 Drawing Operation Batching
- **Current**: Each draw operation immediately writes to display
- **Research Needed**: Optimal batch sizes for ST7789
- **Implementation**: Queue operations, flush in batches
- **Verification**: Profile draw call overhead reduction

### 2. Memory Optimization
**Goal**: Reduce allocations and utilize PSRAM effectively

#### 2.1 PSRAM Frame Buffer
- **Current**: 2MB PSRAM available but unused for display
- **Research Findings**:
  - Use heap_caps_malloc(size, MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM) for PSRAM allocation
  - In Rust: Available via esp_idf_sys bindings
  - PSRAM access slower than internal RAM but good for large buffers
  - Cache coherency critical: esp_idf_sys::Cache_WriteBack_Addr()
  - Alignment matters: 16-byte alignment improves DMA performance
- **Implementation Approach**:
  1. Use heap_caps_malloc with MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM flag
  2. Ensure 16-byte alignment for DMA efficiency
  3. Implement cache flush wrapper for safety
  4. Create PSRAM allocator module for reuse
- **Verification**: Monitor PSRAM usage stats

#### 2.2 Pre-allocated Buffers
- **Current**: Repeated allocations in comprehensive_memory_init()
- **Research Needed**: Static vs dynamic allocation trade-offs
- **Implementation**: Create buffer pool for common operations
- **Verification**: Heap fragmentation analysis

### 3. Task Scheduling & CPU Usage
**Goal**: Better utilize dual-core architecture

#### 3.1 Sensor Sampling on Core 1
- **Current**: All tasks on Core 0
- **Research Findings**:
  - ESP32-S3 has two cores: CPU0 (PRO_CPU) and CPU1 (APP_CPU)
  - Use xTaskCreatePinnedToCore() to pin tasks to specific core
  - Core 0 typically handles WiFi/BT, Core 1 for user apps
  - In Rust: Access via unsafe FFI with esp_idf_sys
  - Task affinity improves determinism and load distribution
- **Implementation Approach**:
  1. Create sensor task with xTaskCreatePinnedToCore(..., 1)
  2. Use unsafe extern "C" functions for task entry
  3. Move sensor sampling logic to dedicated task
  4. Use FreeRTOS queues for inter-core communication
- **Verification**: Core usage statistics

#### 3.2 Main Loop Rate Optimization
- **Current**: 60 FPS cap but display only does 10 FPS
- **Research Needed**: Optimal update rates for UI responsiveness
- **Implementation**: Adaptive frame rate based on activity
- **Verification**: Power consumption measurements

### 4. Network Performance
**Goal**: Reduce WiFi overhead and improve reliability

#### 4.1 Background Signal Monitoring
- **Current**: Signal strength only checked on connect
- **Research Needed**: ESP-IDF WiFi event callbacks
- **Implementation**: Periodic background RSSI updates
- **Verification**: Network stability metrics

### 5. Power Management
**Goal**: Reduce power consumption during idle

#### 5.1 Dynamic Frequency Scaling Enhancement
- **Current**: Basic DFS 80-240MHz
- **Research Findings**:
  - esp_pm_configure() enables DFS and auto light-sleep
  - Set light_sleep_enable=true in esp_pm_config_t
  - Power management adds 0.2-40μs interrupt latency
  - Use power locks to prevent sleep during critical ops
  - CPU auto-scales based on load when configured
- **Implementation Approach**:
  1. Enable light_sleep_enable in PM config
  2. Use PM locks during display updates
  3. Lower min_freq_mhz to 40MHz for deeper power savings
  4. Monitor wake latency impact on responsiveness
- **Verification**: Current consumption measurements

#### 5.2 Light Sleep During Idle
- **Current**: No sleep modes used
- **Research Findings**:
  - Light sleep: ~0.8mA vs active ~40-80mA
  - Wake latency: <1ms
  - Peripherals clock-gated, context preserved
  - Display will be blank during sleep (peripherals stopped)
  - Auto light-sleep uses FreeRTOS tickless idle
  - CONFIG_FREERTOS_IDLE_TIME_BEFORE_SLEEP sets threshold
- **Implementation Approach**:
  1. Enable CONFIG_FREERTOS_USE_TICKLESS_IDLE
  2. Set idle threshold to 50ms (5 display frames)
  3. Use PM locks to keep awake during user interaction
  4. Wake on button GPIO interrupts
- **Verification**: Power profiler measurements

### 6. Code-Level Optimizations
**Goal**: Reduce CPU cycles in hot paths

#### 6.1 Direct Register Access for GPIO
- **Current**: Using HAL layer for pin operations
- **Research Needed**: Safe direct GPIO register manipulation
- **Implementation**: Replace HAL calls in write_byte()
- **Verification**: Oscilloscope timing measurements

#### 6.2 Aggressive Inlining
- **Current**: Some functions marked inline
- **Research Needed**: Profile-guided optimization
- **Implementation**: Inline all hot-path functions
- **Verification**: Binary size vs performance trade-off

## Practical Security (Personal Use) 🔒

### For Personal/Home Network Use:
**Recommendation**: Since this is on your home network, full security isn't critical. Here's what actually matters:

### Worth Doing:

- [x] **1. Basic OTA Protection** ✅
  - **Why**: Prevent accidental uploads or kids messing with it
  - **Simple Fix**: Just add a hardcoded password check
  ```rust
  // Super simple - good enough for home use
  if req.headers().get("X-OTA-Password") != Some("esp32") {
      return Err(StatusCode::Unauthorized);
  }
  ```
  - **Time**: 10 minutes (actual: 5 minutes!)
  - **Status**: DONE (2025-08-01)
  - **Changes Made**:
    - Added password check in web_server.rs (line 254)
    - Updated ota.sh to send X-OTA-Password header
    - Added 401 error handling in ota.sh
    - Default password: "esp32"
  - **Notes**: Change password in both places if you want something else 

- [x] **2. SHA256 for OTA (Recommended)** ✅
  - **Why**: Prevent bricked device from corrupted upload
  - **Worth it**: YES - this protects YOUR device
  - **Time**: 1-2 hours (actual: 30 minutes)
  - **Status**: DONE (2025-08-01)
  - **Implementation**:
    - Added sha2 crate to dependencies
    - OTA manager calculates SHA256 during upload
    - Verifies against X-SHA256 header before applying update
    - ota.sh automatically calculates and sends SHA256
    - Rejects corrupted/mismatched firmware
  - **How it works**:
    1. ota.sh calculates SHA256 of firmware
    2. Sends as X-SHA256 header with upload
    3. ESP32 calculates SHA256 as it receives data
    4. Compares before applying update
    5. Rejects if mismatch
  - **Notes**: This is important protection for your device!

### Optional/Skip for Personal Use:

- [ ] 🤔 **3. Telnet Authentication**
  - **Why Skip**: It's just logs, on your home network
  - **Alternative**: Just disable if you're not using it
  - **Decision**: 
  - **Notes**:

- [ ] 🤔 **4. WiFi Credentials in NVS**
  - **Why Skip**: For personal use, compiled creds are fine
  - **Easier**: Just use `wifi_config.h`
  - **Decision**:
  - **Notes**:

- [ ] 🤔 **5. Rate Limiting**
  - **Why Skip**: Home network, not exposed to internet
  - **Decision**:
  - **Notes**:

- **Finding**:
- **Notes**:

### Lessons Learned:
1. PSRAM frame buffer killed performance (96% slower!)
2. ESP_LCD DMA was the key to 60 FPS
3. Tool version locks exist for good reasons
4. 

### Personal Preferences:
- [ ] Prefer simple solutions over "proper" ones
- [ ] Security is less important than reliability
- [ ] Quick iteration beats perfect code
- [ ] If it works, don't over-engineer it

## Quick Wins (Actually Quick!) 🚀

### 10-Minute Fixes:

- [x] **1. Basic OTA Password** ✅
  ```rust
  // Good enough for home use
  if req.headers().get("X-OTA-Password") != Some("esp32") {
      return Err(StatusCode::Unauthorized);
  }
  ```
  - **Done**: 2025-08-01 (5 minutes!)
  - **Notes**: Remember to update password in both web_server.rs and ota.sh

- [x] **2. Fix Partition Config** ✅
  ```bash
  # Make everything use the same CSV
  CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_CUSTOM_FILENAME="partition_table/partitions_ota.csv"
  ```
  - **Done**: 2025-08-01 (Already fixed!)
  - **Notes**: Fixed all partition CSVs and flash offsets

- [x] **3. Add mDNS** ✅
  ```rust
  // Access via esp32.local
  mdns.set_hostname("esp32")?;
  ```
  - **Done**: 2025-08-01 (Already implemented!)
  - **Notes**: Just needed to update hostname and fix scripts

### 30-Minute Improvements:

- [x] **4. WiFi Auto-Reconnect** ✅ (Already done!)

## Personal Project Success Metrics 🎯

### What Actually Matters:
- [ ] **Reliability**: Stays running for weeks
- [ ] **Convenience**: Easy to update via OTA
- [ ] **Performance**: Smooth UI (✅ achieved!)
- [ ] **Usability**: Works without fiddling

### What Doesn't Matter (for personal use):
- ❌ Perfect security (it's on home network)
- ❌ CI/CD pipeline (just build locally)
- ❌ Comprehensive docs (you wrote it)
- ❌ Production-grade monitoring

---

## Useful Commands & Tips 📋

### Common Tasks:
```bash
# Quick build & flash
./compile.sh && ./scripts/flash.sh

# OTA update
./scripts/ota.sh find
./scripts/ota.sh <IP>

# Monitor logs
./scripts/monitor-telnet.py

# Full erase (when things go wrong)
espflash erase-flash
```

### Troubleshooting:
- **WiFi not connecting**: Check serial output first
- **OTA failing**: Verify partition alignment
- **Performance issues**: Check if PSRAM frame buffer got enabled
- **Build errors**: Close VS Code, try again
