# Socket Exhaustion Investigation Summary

## Initial Problem
The device was freezing when handling multiple concurrent HTTP connections, becoming completely unresponsive after ~10-15 requests.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Socket Limit**: ESP-IDF HTTP server has a default limit of 10 sockets total, with 3 reserved internally
2. **Configuration Issue**: The default configuration was not optimal for handling concurrent connections
3. **Connection Management**: Connections were not being closed properly, leading to socket exhaustion

## Solution Attempted
1. **HTTP Configuration**: 
   - Set `max_open_sockets: 7` (maximum allowed)
   - Enabled `lru_purge_enable: true` for automatic connection cleanup
   - Added `Connection: close` headers to all responses

2. **Code Changes**:
   - Created `http_config.rs` for centralized HTTP configuration
   - Updated `compression.rs` to add Connection headers
   - Modified web server initialization

## Current Status
The socket exhaustion fix was implemented correctly, but testing revealed a different issue:
- **WiFi Disconnection**: The device is disconnecting from WiFi immediately after connecting
- **Not HTTP Related**: The web server never gets a chance to run because WiFi drops
- This explains why all connections are being reset - there's no network connectivity

## Next Steps
1. Investigate WiFi disconnection issue (separate from socket exhaustion)
2. Once WiFi is stable, the socket exhaustion fix should work correctly
3. Consider implementing connection pooling in test clients

## Key Learnings
1. ESP-IDF has hard limits on sockets that must be respected
2. Connection: close headers are essential for preventing socket exhaustion
3. LRU purging helps manage connections automatically
4. Always verify network connectivity before debugging HTTP issues

## Test Results
- Before fix: Device froze after ~10 concurrent connections
- After fix: Cannot verify due to WiFi disconnection issue
- The fix is theoretically correct based on ESP-IDF documentation
