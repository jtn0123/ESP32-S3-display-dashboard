# ESP LCD Power Fix Status

## Problem
Display shows nothing despite logs showing success. The root cause was identified:
1. **Missing Power Management**: Backlight and LCD power pins weren't being enabled
2. **Color Order**: Was using BGR instead of RGB  
3. **MADCTL Value**: Was using 0xA0 instead of 0x60
4. **Viewport Mapping**: Y offset of 35 pixels (already configured correctly)

## Fixes Applied in Latest Build

### 1. Power Pin Management
- Moved power pin management to `LcdDisplayManager`
- Added proper initialization sequence:
  ```rust
  // Initialize power pins
  let mut backlight_pin = PinDriver::output(backlight.downgrade())?;
  let mut lcd_power_pin = PinDriver::output(lcd_power.downgrade())?;
  let mut rd_pin = PinDriver::output(rd.downgrade())?;
  
  // Enable LCD power and backlight
  lcd_power_pin.set_high()?;
  backlight_pin.set_high()?;
  rd_pin.set_high()?; // RD pin should be high for write-only mode
  ```

### 2. Simplified Architecture
- Removed power pin handling from `LcdCamDisplay` struct
- Power pins are now managed by `LcdDisplayManager` 
- This avoids complex refactoring through multiple layers

### 3. All Previous Fixes Retained
- ✅ RGB color order (not BGR)
- ✅ MADCTL value = 0x60
- ✅ Viewport gap Y=35
- ✅ Proper landscape orientation
- ✅ Debug test with raw commands

## Build Summary
- Clean build completed successfully
- Flashed to device (v4.69-rust)
- No compilation errors

## Next Steps
1. Monitor serial output to verify:
   - "Power pins configured - LCD power and backlight enabled" message
   - Display actually shows visual content
   - FPS benchmarks run successfully

2. If display still shows nothing:
   - Check voltage on GPIO15 (LCD power) and GPIO38 (backlight)
   - Verify the display isn't damaged
   - Try the reference C code to confirm hardware works

## Technical Notes
The T-Display-S3 requires:
- GPIO15 (LCD_PWR) to be HIGH for display power
- GPIO38 (BK_LIGHT) to be HIGH for backlight
- GPIO9 (RD) to be HIGH for write-only mode

Without these pins enabled, the display will receive no power and show nothing, regardless of how correct the data transmission is.
