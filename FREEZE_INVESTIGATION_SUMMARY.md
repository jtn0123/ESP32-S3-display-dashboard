# Device Freeze Investigation Summary

## Issue Description
The ESP32-S3 device freezes after handling just 1-2 HTTP requests, even with sequential connections and delays between requests.

## Key Findings

### 1. Not Socket Exhaustion
- Device freezes with just 1-2 sequential requests
- Socket exhaustion typically requires 7-10 concurrent connections
- Added `Connection: close` headers and proper socket configuration

### 2. Not WiFi Disconnection
- WiFi power save disabled properly
- Added stabilization delays after connection
- WiFi remains connected initially but device becomes unresponsive

### 3. Not Memory Exhaustion
- Free heap: 8.4MB (very high)
- Memory leak minimal: ~1.5KB over 148 requests
- However: `largest_free_block: 0` is suspicious

### 4. Compression May Be Contributing
- Home page is 22KB uncompressed
- Disabling compression didn't fully solve the issue
- Device still freezes but may take slightly longer

## Freeze Pattern
1. Device boots successfully
2. WiFi connects and gets IP
3. Web server starts
4. First HTTP request succeeds
5. Second request causes immediate freeze
6. Device becomes completely unresponsive (no ping, no telnet)
7. Recovery requires physical reset

## Possible Root Causes

### 1. HTTP Server Thread/Task Issue
- Request handler may be blocking or crashing
- Stack overflow in request handling task
- Race condition in ESP-IDF HTTP server

### 2. PSRAM/Memory Configuration
- `largest_free_block: 0` suggests memory fragmentation
- PSRAM may not be properly initialized
- Memory allocation failure during request handling

### 3. Watchdog Timer Issue
- Request handling may be triggering watchdog reset
- Watchdog may be too aggressive for HTTP operations

### 4. ESP-IDF HTTP Server Bug
- Known issues with certain configurations
- May need different server implementation

## Next Steps

1. **Add comprehensive logging** to HTTP request handlers
2. **Monitor task stack usage** during requests
3. **Check watchdog timer configuration**
4. **Test with minimal HTTP handler** (no template rendering)
5. **Investigate PSRAM configuration**
6. **Consider alternative HTTP server** (e.g., simple custom implementation)

## Temporary Workaround
None found yet. Device requires physical reset after freeze.
