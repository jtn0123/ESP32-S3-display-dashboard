# ESP LCD Display Fix Report

## Problem Summary

The ESP LCD implementation was initializing successfully (showing good logs and FPS) but the display remained blank. This is because:

1. **Generic ST7789 driver insufficient**: The ESP-IDF's generic ST7789 driver doesn't send all the initialization commands required by the T-Display-S3
2. **Missing critical commands**: Specifically missing:
   - INVON (0x21) - Display inversion ON
   - Power control commands (PORCTRL, VCOMS, etc.)
   - Proper MADCTL value (0x60 for landscape mode)
3. **Controller memory not cleared**: The entire 480x320 controller memory needs to be cleared to black

## Solution Implemented

Created `esp_lcd_custom_init.rs` that adds custom initialization after the ESP-IDF driver init:

```rust
// Critical commands for T-Display-S3:
send_cmd(CMD_MADCTL, &[0x60])?;     // Landscape mode
send_cmd(CMD_INVON, &[])?;          // Display inversion ON (critical!)
send_cmd(CMD_PORCTRL, &[0x0C, 0x0C, 0x00, 0x33, 0x33])?;
send_cmd(CMD_VCOMS, &[0x19])?;      // VCOM setting
// ... other power control commands

// Clear entire controller memory (480x320) to black
send_cmd(CMD_CASET, &[0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0xDF])?; // 0-479
send_cmd(CMD_RASET, &[0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x3F])?; // 0-319
// Write black pixels to entire memory
```

## Key Findings

1. **ESP-IDF limitations**: The high-level ESP-IDF driver abstracts away too much - it doesn't expose the ability to send custom initialization sequences
2. **Panel-specific requirements**: Different ST7789 panels require different initialization sequences. The T-Display-S3 is particularly sensitive
3. **Display inversion critical**: Without INVON command, colors are inverted making a black screen appear white

## Status

- ‚úÖ Custom initialization added
- ‚úÖ Build successful
- ‚è≥ Awaiting hardware test with custom init
- üìã If display works, performance should remain at ~31 FPS

## Next Steps

1. Flash and test with custom initialization
2. If display shows content, run full benchmarks
3. If still not working, may need to:
   - Bypass ESP-IDF panel driver entirely
   - Use raw panel IO commands for all operations
   - Implement custom ST7789 driver on top of I80 bus
