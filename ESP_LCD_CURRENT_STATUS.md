# ESP LCD Current Status

## Problem
Display shows nothing despite logs showing success. Multiple issues found:

1. **Power Management**: Backlight and LCD power pins weren't being handled
2. **Color Order**: Was using BGR instead of RGB  
3. **MADCTL Value**: Was using 0xA0 instead of 0x60
4. **Viewport Mapping**: Y offset of 35 pixels configured correctly

## Recent Fixes Applied
- ✅ Added backlight and LCD power pin management
- ✅ Changed from BGR to RGB color order
- ✅ Fixed MADCTL value to match working GPIO code (0x60)
- ✅ Added debug test with raw commands
- ✅ Set proper gap with esp_lcd_panel_set_gap(0, 35)

## Current Issue
Code refactoring in progress - need to properly pass the power pins through all layers.

## Next Steps
1. Fix the compilation errors with pin parameters
2. Test with all fixes applied
3. Check if display finally shows content
