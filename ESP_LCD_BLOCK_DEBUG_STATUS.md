# ESP LCD Block Debug Status

## Version: v5.39-blockdbg

Successfully built and flashed the ESP32 with comprehensive block debugging.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Block Pattern Debug (`esp_lcd_block_debug.rs`)
- Single pixel writes to verify basic communication
- Different block sizes (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 pixels)
- Transfer alignment patterns
- Transfer size optimization (2-1024 bytes)
- Memory barrier tests
- **6-Block Pattern Specific Tests:**
  - 6-pixel wide columns
  - Every 6th pixel different
  - Colored block identification (R,G,B,W,Y,M)
  - DMA descriptor boundary tests

### 2. Timing Debug (`esp_lcd_timing_debug.rs`)
- Inter-operation delays (0-500us)
- Different transfer speeds with delays
- Memory barriers and synchronization
- Bus timing verification
- **6-Block Timing Specific Tests:**
  - 6-block width stripes with 1us gaps
  - Every 6th pixel white pattern
  - Block identification with 6 distinct colors

## What to Watch For in Serial Output

Look for these debug messages:
```
=== Running block pattern debug ===
Testing for blocky display with 6 readable blocks...

=== 6-BLOCK PATTERN DEBUG ===
Test 1: 6-pixel columns
  If this shows clean columns, it's a 6-pixel alignment issue

Pattern 2: Every 6th pixel different
  If you see vertical white lines, it confirms 6-pixel period

Pattern 3: Block identification
  Drew 6 colored blocks (R,G,B,W,Y,M)
  Note which colors you can see clearly

=== ESP LCD BLOCK DEBUG ===
Test 1: Single pixel writes
Test 2: Testing different block sizes
Test 3: Testing transfer alignment
Test 4: Testing transfer sizes
Test 5: Memory barrier test

=== 6-BLOCK TIMING TEST ===
Pattern 1: 6-block width stripes
Pattern 2: Every 6th pixel different
Pattern 3: Block identification

=== ESP LCD TIMING DEBUG ===
Test 1: Adding inter-operation delays
Test 2: Drawing pattern with various delays
Test 3: Testing flush and sync
Test 4: Testing timing at different speeds
Test 5: Bus timing verification
```

## Monitor Output

The device successfully connected to WiFi and is running. To see the display debug output:
1. Power cycle the device
2. Watch the serial output during boot
3. The ESP LCD initialization happens early in the boot process

## Next Steps

1. Power cycle the device to see the full boot sequence
2. Observe which patterns appear on the display
3. Note which blocks/colors are readable
4. Based on results:
   - If 6-pixel columns are clean → Pixel alignment issue
   - If delays help → Timing issue
   - If specific colors show → Color channel issue
   - If memory barriers help → Cache coherency issue
